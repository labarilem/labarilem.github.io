Recently moved from Bari to Pisa, Italy. You've probably heard about its [Leaning Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa).

Working as Senior Software Engineer at Smartness, in full remote. Cool job where I manage infra and write code too.

Started training in powerlifting with a local team in mid-December. I hope to compete next year in a couple of meets but I'm still a beginner. Current 1RMs: 170kg/110kg/180kg. Getting professional coaching will probably help me increase my strength faster.

Building some software tools and projects on my backlog, some for fun like [HN Games](https://hackernews.games/) and some for fun and profit like a couple of stocks trading bots.

This is my now page, one of the many in the [now movement](https://nownownow.com/about).
