title: About me
---

I'm a pragmatic software engineer who's all about solving hard challenges with tech. With a focus on backend and infra, my preferred stack includes Node.js, Postgres, and AWS. Also, I co-founded and served as CTO for a bootstrapped AR tech startup for ~2 years.

I've been passionate about software development since I first got my hands on a PC. I started fiddling with a Windows 98 terminal then at 13 years old I wrote my first program, a simple Visual Basic calculator.

When I'm not dealing with code, you might find me strenght training at the gym, enjoying food and music, or blogging.
