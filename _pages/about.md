title: About me
---

I'm a pragmatic software engineer who's all about solving hard challenges with tech. With a focus on backend and infra, my preferred stack includes Node.js, Postgres, and AWS. Also, I co-founded and served as CTO for a bootstrapped tech startup for ~2 years.

My passion for computer science ignited back in my teenage years and has been burning ever since.

When I'm not dealing with code, you might find me strenght training at the gym, enjoying food and music, or pouring my thoughts into the cyberspace.
