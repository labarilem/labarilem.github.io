title: About me
---

I'm a pragmatic software engineer who's all about solving hard challenges with tech. With a strong focus on backend and infrastructure, my preferred stack includes Node.js, Postgres, and AWS. Also, I co-founded and served as CTO for a bootstrapped tech startup for ~2 years.

My passion for computer science ignited back in my teenage years and has been burning ever since.

When I'm not writing code, you might find me pumping iron at the gym, crafting beats in FL Studio, or pouring my thoughts into the digital realm.
