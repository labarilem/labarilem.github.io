A brief history of my approach to note taking.

## High school

While in high school, I was taking lots of [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) (most of them about AI and ML) and reading some technical books, but I did not have a systematic approach to note taking: I used to focus only on exercises and applications.

## Undergrad

My attitude changed as I started attending lessons for an undergraduate degree in mathematics. During that time I found out different ways to efficiently schematize and organize the presented maths theory, but it was mostly *pen and paper* work.

## IT industry

Now that I'm in the IT industry I've come back to ebooks and video lessons, so I decided to take digital notes, which come with several benefits:

- Have you ever forgot something that you took note of? Just upload your notes to the cloud to read them every time you want to.
- The cloud will also help you add new notes to your collection without messy synchronization processes.
- You can include any kind of hypermedia (e.g. cool diagrams, links to external resources) with ease.
- It's easier to share digital notes with other people.

So I came up with this setup:

- **Notes format:** I'm using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to quickly write well-formatted and readable notes.
- **Site builder:** [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (with the [material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme) generates a good-looking static website from the Markdown I write.
- **Source control:** Public git repository owned by my personal GitHub account.
- **Hosting:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), amazing service which is offering free HTTPS certificates too (thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)).

This setup grants all the previously listed benefits, while being *agile* enough to let you write notes on the fly.

I like to keep my notes open because I hope they could prove useful for someone out there. Also, if you spot errors of any kind, you're welcome to open a pull request to fix them.
