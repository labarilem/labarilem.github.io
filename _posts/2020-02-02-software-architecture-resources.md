Currently I'm thinking about moving to a software architect role. Designing systems has been a passion of mine since I started to write software.

That's why I've [asked the HN community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22202769) which are some of the best resources to learn software architecture. If you are in this situation too, you might find the following links of interest:
