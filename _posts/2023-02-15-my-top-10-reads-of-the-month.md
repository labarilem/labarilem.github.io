Welcome to my monthly digest! Here you will find some of the best articles, posts and projects I've found this month:

- [Googleâ€™s fully homomorphic encryption compiler](https://jeremykun.com/2023/02/13/googles-fully-homomorphic-encryption-compiler-a-primer/).
- [Gravity batteries and abandoned mines could work well together](https://www.techspot.com/news/97306-gravity-batteries-abandoned-mines-could-power-whole-planet.html). Personally I didn't know about gravity batteries before, it's a cool idea.
- [A woman receives the first-ever successful transplant of a living, 3D-printed ear](https://www.zmescience.com/science/first-3d-printed-ear-own-cells-264243/)

- [The FBI Identified a Tor User](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/01/the-fbi-identified-a-tor-user.html).
- [Gluon](https://github.com/gluon-framework/gluon), a new framework for creating desktop apps from websites using system installed browsers and Node.js.
- A [ChatGPT overview](https://lifearchitect.ai/chatgpt/). Definitely one of my favourite non-technical articles on the topic.
- Don't forget to update yout Git installations. Just like every software, [Git has security vulnerabilities](https://github.blog/2023-01-17-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-2/).
- [Prime Voice AI](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) by ElevenLabs is a realistic AI speech software.
- Be careful when working with cloud CI pipelines. [They can be hacked too](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/14/circleci-hackers-stole-customer-source-code/).
