Welcome to my monthly digest! Here you will find some of the best articles, posts and projects I've found this month:

- [The cloudy layers of modern-day programming](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/).
- [Awesome ChatGPT prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) and [OpenAI cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook) to have some fun with AIs.
- [How to spot AI-generated text](https://archive.ph/c4Avq).
- [Just use Postgres for everything](https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/). Lots of developers underestimate the capabilities of Postgres (my favourite DBMS btw).
- [Riffusion](https://www.riffusion.com/about) uses Stable Diffusion to generate images of spectrograms, which can be converted into audio clips. Smart way to generate music!
- [Lofty Ambitions](https://www.damninteresting.com/lofty-ambitions/): in 1933, British WWI vet Maurice Wilson hatched an unorthodox plan to reach the still-untouched summit of Everest.
- [Doom Christmas Bauble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9ODhV40aEI) for a nerdy Christmas.
- Scientists have created for the first time a synthetic [eight-letter genetic language](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/4-new-dna-letters-double-lifes-alphabet/) that seems to store and transcribe information just like natural DNA.
- Disney’s new [neural network](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/disney-creates-ai-fountain-of-youth-for-actors/) can change an actor’s age with ease.
- What is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs? [Research & criticisms](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-research).
