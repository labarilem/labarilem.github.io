Npmfix is a CLI tool that fixes integrity check failure problems with NPM packages.

It came to be after I faced some issues I met while working with NPM packages.

When:

- you need to frequently link NPM packages to speed up development
- you run integration tests that automatically install packages from local tarballs

and then you run CI builds on a build server, some bad things start to happen.

By bad things I mean *integrity check failures*. NPM makes sure that the checksum of a published package matches the checksum of the package you download (or fetch from your local cache). This was the actual source of my problems: something was messing with the checksums in the package lock, causing failures on the builds run by build agents.

In theory, you could solve these issues by disabling [package lock files](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json), but this has some potentially undesired effects:

- you lose the guarantee that build servers and dev machines will install the same versions of packages
- packages installation will take more time because NPM can't skip metadata resolution in this case

This was the solution I embraced for the projects that did not need the features of package lock files.

But, for the remaining projects, I found myself deleting package lock files and *node_modules* folders a lot, sometimes even cleaning the global NPM cache, before pushing changes that would trigger CI builds. And of course then I needed to reinstall the whole lot of packages too. This took some time and I also felt like a human executing a script.

So I wrote a Node.js CLI tool to replace me in this tedious task. Npmfix is based on a very simple algorithm:

1. Continue only if the current folder has a package.json file
2. Delete the node_modules folder
3. Delete the package-lock.json file

which can be extended (recursive search, global cache clean, etc.) by passing flags to the CLI.
