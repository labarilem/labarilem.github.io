Being a fan of pizza I had to visit Naples, which hosts the majority of the best pizzerias in the world.

So much pizza but so little time! We consulted some of the most authoritative sources to identify the best pizzerias:

- [Michelin Guide for Naples](https://travelguide.michelin.com/restaurants/7509)
- [Gambero Rosso](http://www.gamberorosso.it/it/food/1045892-guida-pizzerie-d-italia-2018-del-gambero-rosso-elenco-dei-migliori-e-dei-premiati) (italian guide)
- [Where to eat pizza](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Eat-Pizza-Daniel-Young/dp/0714871168) (aka *The Pizza Bible*)

**Did you know?** No Michelin stars have been awarded to pizzerias in 2018. Quite surprising to me.

We had a hard time trying to filter out pizzerias in those lists: how can you exclude one of those from your trip? They all look wonderful.

Eventually we agreed on a small list and these are the ones we managed to try:

- [50 Kalò](#50-kalò)
- [L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele](#lantica-pizzeria-da-michele)
- [Gino Sorbillo Antica Pizzeria](#gino-sorbillo-antica-pizzeria)
- [Concettina ai Tre Santi](#concettina-ai-tre-santi)
- [La Masardona](#la-masardona)
- [Di Matteo](#di-matteo)
- [La Figlia del Presidente](#la-figlia-del-presidente)

## 50 Kalò

##### [Website](http://www.xn--50kal-yta.it/index.php/en) [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d6226929-Reviews-50_Kalo_Di_Ciro_Salvo-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html)

In the neapolitan *Smorfia* the number 50 represents bread. In the pizza makers jargon the word *kalò* means *good* (comes from the greek term *kalos*). So **50 Kalò means good dough**.

But *good* does not describe the dough well enough: it's the best I've ever eaten, including the other options in Naples.

The research and passion of Ciro Salvo leads to a really soft, light and highly digestible dough. Add top quality ingredients and you get one of the best pizzas in the world.

We also tried a classic fried pizza here, the *montanara*: it's surprisingly light and tasteful.

Pizza at 50 Kalò is a true masterpiece, something you won't easily forget. In fact, it's the only pizzeria in Naples where we dined a second time. Also, at 1 minute's walking distance from 50 Kalò you can find the famous seafront road *Via Caracciolo*.
