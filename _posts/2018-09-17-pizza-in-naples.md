Being a fan of pizza I had to visit Naples, which hosts the majority of the best pizzerias in the world.

So much pizza but so little time! We consulted some of the most authoritative sources to identify the best pizzerias:

- [Michelin Guide for Naples](https://travelguide.michelin.com/restaurants/7509)
- [Gambero Rosso](http://www.gamberorosso.it/it/food/1045892-guida-pizzerie-d-italia-2018-del-gambero-rosso-elenco-dei-migliori-e-dei-premiati) (italian guide)
- [Where to eat pizza](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Eat-Pizza-Daniel-Young/dp/0714871168) (aka *The Pizza Bible*) by Daniel Young

**Did you know?** No Michelin stars have been awarded to pizzerias in 2018. Quite surprising to me.
{: .notice--info}

We had a hard time trying to filter out pizzerias in those lists: how can you exclude one of those from your trip? They all look wonderful.

Eventually we agreed on a small list and these are the ones we managed to try:

- [50 Kalò](#50-kalò)
- [L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele](#lantica-pizzeria-da-michele)
- [Gino Sorbillo Antica Pizzeria](#gino-sorbillo-antica-pizzeria)
- [Concettina ai Tre Santi](#concettina-ai-tre-santi)
- [La Masardona](#la-masardona)
- [Di Matteo](#di-matteo)
- [La Figlia del Presidente](#la-figlia-del-presidente)

## 50 Kalò

##### [:globe_with_meridians: Website](http://www.xn--50kal-yta.it/index.php/en) | [:book: TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d6226929-Reviews-50_Kalo_Di_Ciro_Salvo-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html) | :pizza: Price range: 5-10€

In the neapolitan *Smorfia* the number 50 represents bread. In the pizza makers jargon the word *kalò* means *good* (comes from the greek term *kalos*). So **50 Kalò means good dough**.

But *good* does not describe the dough well enough: it's the best I've ever eaten, including the other options in Naples.

{% include gallery columns=3 id="kalo-gallery" height="50" class="full" caption="50 Kalò's pizza. What a dough." %}

The research and passion of Ciro Salvo leads to a really soft, light and highly digestible dough. Add top quality ingredients and you get one of the best pizzas in the world.

We also tried a classic fried pizza here, the *montanara*: it's surprisingly light and tasteful.

{% include gallery columns=1 id="kalo-fried-gallery" height="50" class="full" caption="50 Kalò's fried pizza. What a fried dough." %}

The restaurant has comfortable rooms with the kitchen placed at the entrance and outdoor seats too. I especially liked the fact that here you don't share tables with people you don't know, as it allows for a quiet and more private experience while your senses marvel over the delicious pizza.

If you try to get in as soon as it opens, you probably won't need to wait in a queue, even though you will see few people waiting outside. In popular dining hours on weekend evenings you'll need to wait about 30 minutes.

Also, at 1 minute walking distance from 50 Kalò you can find the port of the famous seafront road *Via Caracciolo*.

Pizza at 50 Kalò is a true masterpiece, something you won't easily forget. In fact, it's the only pizzeria in Naples where we dined a second time.

## L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele

##### [:globe_with_meridians: Website](http://www.damichele.net/) | [:book: TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d1235237-Reviews-L_Antica_Pizzeria_da_Michele-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html) | :pizza: Price range: 5-7€

Since the 1870, the Condurro family has been perfecting the art of making pizza. This journey began with Michele Condurro, the forefather of a family of pizza chefs that has been making the best margherita pizza in the world for a long time.

The menu is rather simple and traditional: you can only order a margherita or marinara pizza.

{% include gallery columns=2 id="michele-gallery" height="50" class="full" caption="That table is quite crude. But that margherita..." %}

The dough is both soft and dense. The ingredients are excellent, you can taste the superb mixed flavors of sauce, oil, mozzarella and basil. The pizza here is so simple and so good, I've never had a margherita like this one before.

The restaurant is quite crude and traditional, also it's somewhat chaotic. Here you will probably be sharing your table with strangers and that's a different experience from the usual, strangers may be nice people or a bit annoying but it's a risk you have to take for the good of your own taste buds.

We were lucky enough to sit in front of the wood oven so we were able to see how the pizza chefs cooked the best margheritas in the world. A wonderful experience.

There is always a queue in front of the pizzeria, we were able to get in after waiting about 30 minutes.

If you ever wondered how the best margherita pizza in the world tastes, just visit the *Antica Pizzeria da Michele* to get your answers.
