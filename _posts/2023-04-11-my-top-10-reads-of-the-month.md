Welcome to my monthly digest! Here you will find some of the best articles, posts and projects I've found this month.

I've decided to stop including ChatGPT news in my digest as you probably already know them from other newsletters and blogs you follow.

So here we go:

- MIT reasearchers are working on [Codon](https://spectrum.ieee.org/python-compiler), a native Python compiler.
- Chrome shipped [WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/) without flags.
- [This X Does Not Exist](https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/), if you liked This Person Does Not Exist.
- There is a black market for GitHub stars too and it has been [analyzed](https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars).
- Timescale has built a [scalable S3 storage tier for Postgres](https://www.timescale.com/blog/scaling-postgresql-with-amazon-s3-an-object-storage-for-low-cost-infinite-database-scalability).
- [This extensions](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-jsonschema-a-postgres-extension-for-json-validation) add JSON Schema support to Postgres JSON types.
- [Two U.S. Men Charged in 2022 Hacking of DEA Portal](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/two-us-men-charged-in-2022-hacking-of-dea-portal/), alleged to be sending fake emercency requests from compromised police accounts to extract data from companies.
- [Containers are chroot with a Marketing Budget](https://earthly.dev/blog/chroot/). I've found this one of the best articles explaining what a container runtime is under the hood without getting too much technical.
- [This drone](https://gizmodo.com/drone-see-through-walls-wifi-wi-peep-waterloo-research-1849744061) can "see through walls" using Wifi.
- [markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) lets you build mind maps using Markdown.
