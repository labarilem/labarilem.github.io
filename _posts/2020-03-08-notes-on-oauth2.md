I've recently added new topics to my [public notes](https://marcolabarile.me/notes/):

- [JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://marcolabarile.me/notes/oauth2-and-openid-connect/jwt/), a standard for creating JSON access tokens that can assert a number of claims.
- [OAuth 2.0](https://marcolabarile.me/notes/oauth2-and-openid-connect/oauth2/), is an open framework that allows to securely obtain authorization to access resources via HTTP.
- [OpenID Connect](https://marcolabarile.me/notes/oauth2-and-openid-connect/openid-connect/), an authentication protocol. It builds upon OAuth 2.0 and JWT to provide users one login for multiple sites.

When I was reading about these topics online, I did not find any _comprehensive_ sequence diagrams which were also up to date with the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications. With these notes, I'm trying to offer a high-level yet not-too-abstract view on these topics.

As always, you can let me know if you find any mistakes in my notes by creating a PR in the [notes' GitHub repository](https://github.com/labarilem/notes).
