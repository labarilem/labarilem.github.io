Welcome to my monthly digest! Here you will find some of the best articles, posts and projects I've found this month:

- Romanian government now has its own [AI assistant](https://www-digi24-ro.translate.goog/stiri/actualitate/politica/guvernul-si-a-luat-robot-il-cheama-ion-si-este-consilierul-lui-ciuca-2268303?__grrn=1&__grsc=cookieIsUndef0&__grts=55924920&__grua=08c86af9d1e51eabde3ca20c5e293308&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en).
- Japanese company brings [expensive space tourism](https://www.yankodesign.com/2023/02/27/japanese-company-brings-astronomically-expensive-space-tourism-within-reach-of-the-common-masses/) within reach of the common masses.
- [Jailbreak Chat](https://www.jailbreakchat.com/), a collection of ChatGPT prompts evading OpenAI filters.
- Stable Diffusion can be used to create 2D game environments. The model has some limitations for this task, but [results](https://talesofsyn.com/posts/creating-isometric-rpg-game-backgrounds) can be good.
- [Who's Behind the Botnet-Based Service BHProxies?](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/whos-behind-the-botnet-based-service-bhproxies/) by Brain Krebs.
- [LandingAI](https://landing.ai/) lets you build and deploy computer vision models without requiring deep technical expertise in the field.
- Chrome Manifest v3 was mostly designed to damage ad-blocking extensions while advertised as more secure than the previous version. But it's still possible to build very dangerous extensions with the the new API. Check out this [post](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension) if you want to build one.
- We all heard about LLM prompt engineering, but what about [prompt injection](https://greshake.github.io/) vulnerabilities?
- The story of an engineer leaving Google to work full-time on OSS shows a [viable earning model for maintainers]((https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/)).
- You can now replicate the ChatGPT training process with the new [Colossal-AI's RLHF open source implementation](https://www.hpc-ai.tech/blog/colossal-ai-chatgpt). And it's also not resource-intensive!
