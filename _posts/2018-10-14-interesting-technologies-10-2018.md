Some interesting technologies as of October 2018:

- [Deep image reconstruction from human brain activity](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/DeepImageReconstruction) researched by the Kamitani Lab at Kyoto University.
- [Dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) powered by Google, currently in beta.
- [Wasabi](http://wasabi.software-lab.org/), a dynamic analysis framework for WebAssembly.
- [Everybody Dance Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07371), this paper presents a simple method for *do as I do* motion transfer.
- [NVIDIA vid2vid](https://github.com/NVIDIA/vid2vid), high-resolution photorealistic video-to-video translation using Pytorch.
- [The Sound of Pixels](http://sound-of-pixels.csail.mit.edu/), a system that learns to locate image regions which produce sounds and separate the input sounds.
- [Walt](https://github.com/ballercat/walt), a JavaScript-like syntax for WebAssembly text format.
- [JavaScript Visualizer](https://tylermcginnis.com/javascript-visualizer/), a tool for visualizing Execution Context, Hoisting, Closures, and Scopes in JavaScript.
- [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score), a tool that does static code analysis of your Kubernetes object definitions.
- [BrainNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08632v1), a multi-person brain-to-brain interface for direct collaboration between brains.
- [Rosetta](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/10/01/rosetta-large-scale-system-for-text-detection-and-recognition-in-images/), Facebookâ€™s production system for extracting text (OCR) from uploaded images.
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), network-wide ad blocking via your own linux hardware.
- [Wasmjit](https://github.com/rianhunter/wasmjit), a small embeddable WebAssembly runtime. Its core is written in C90 and is easily portable to most environments.
