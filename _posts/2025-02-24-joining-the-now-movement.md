I recently added a [/now page](/now) to my blog.
It’s a simple page where I share what I’m currently doing, thinking about or focusing on in my life.

It’s inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about), a movement started by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) to encourage people to keep an updated, personal status page—kind of like an “about me”, but for the present moment.

Most personal sites have an `/about` page, but that’s usually static. A `/now` page, though, is dynamic.
It reflects what’s happening in my life right now, not just who I am.

I like the idea because it keeps my blog **personal** and it might help create **connections** with visitors.

If you have a personal website or blog, I highly recommend adding a `/now` page.
It’s easy to set up, and it gives visitors a better sense of what you’re actually doing.

Let me know if you end up making one too, because I’d definitely read it to satisfy my curiosity.
I’m not kidding, I’ve spent way too much time reading [other people’s /now pages](https://nownownow.com/).
