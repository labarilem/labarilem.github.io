Python is not only a language, some may consider it a way of life. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and its wide range of applications can make it difficult to just get started and familiarize with it.

So I've done some reasearch for you, an experienced programmer looking to get into Python.

Let's dive in:

1. Use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python installations. [Install it](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#getting-pyenv) then install a Python 3.* version using its CLI.

2. Download and install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). 

3. Follow the official Python 3 [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

4. Code a simple but fun project with Python. Some ideas: 
  - If you're into NLP, build a [spelling corrector](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).
  - If you're looking for CRUD Web APIs, go for the [FastAPI tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/).


5. Don't write a blog post about learning Python. This will save ~1h of your time.
