It's been a couple of very intensive years: from switching to a permanent tech lead role to co-founding my first startup and being a CTO for the first time in my life.

Add some social life, gym, and hobbies to this and you will have little time left to write meaningful blog posts.

So I'm trying to get back to blogging from time to time and I have some ideas to work on.

## Weekly digests of my reads
I love to keep up with the latest tech news and read up on lots of topics. I aim to publish a weekly post to share the articles I've read and found most interesting during the week.

## Bug fixes and Style improvements 
Some minor features of my blog theme require updating (e.g. social share buttons), so I'm thinking about reviewing them and removing the ones I don't need.
I also gathered some tips on how I might improve the blog's style and readability. For example, this is the first post I'm writing with the automated assistance of [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) (I'm already starting to like it).

## Quirky tricks and knowledge
These years, I have been solving all kinds of problems. I think some of them deserve their blog post. It would also be another way to give back to the community.

I'm looking forward to my blogging comeback.

See you in the next post!
